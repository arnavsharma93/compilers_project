Description : 
	A parser and AST representation for the decaf programming language with the following specifications - http://192.168.36.187/mediawiki/images/c/c2/Decafspec.pdf
	Made using flex and bison.

Compiling Instructions : 
	make clean; make

	Note : Some UNIX systems might require -lfl instead of -ll in the last command, so you might have to edit the makefile.

Running the parser :
	
	./Parser < input_program

Sample input programs : 
	prog1.txt
	prog2.txt
	prog3.txt
	prog4.txt
	prog5.txt
	prog6.txt

The input program is successfully parsed and a AST representation is printed on the console, with nodes separated by tabs. The Parser throws a syntax error if the input program is not according to Decaf specifications.
